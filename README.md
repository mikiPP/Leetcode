# 🚀 LeetCode Solutions by Miki

This repository contains my structured collection of LeetCode problems, solved as part of my preparation for interviews.  
All solutions are written with the idea of everyone is able to understand the code.

## 🧠 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms.
- Master problem-solving patterns (two pointers, sliding window, backtracking, recursion, DP, graphs…).
- Improve speed, accuracy, and confidence for technical interviews.
- Track progress over time and make solutions easy to revisit.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each problem is organized into the topic of the exercice.

/sliding-window
/binary-search
/two-pointers
/trees

## 🏆 Why This Repo Exists

I'm building this as a long-term tool for:

- Interview prep
- Reviewing patterns quickly
- Improving algorithmic thinking
